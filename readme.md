# SELECTIVE FACE BLUR
Did you ever happen to take a picture of yourself alone or with someone else, with unwanted visitors in the background?
Or perhaps you just want to remove someone's face in an old group picture for whatever reason?

This very easy to use program let's you get rid of non-desired faces across any image!

## Dependencies:
* Python - 3.10.5
* OpenCV - 4.6.0
* Numpy - 1.22.4
* Streamlit - 1.10.0
## How to use:
To run the Streamlit app locally, just go to *src/streamlit* inside this workspace and type:

```console
    $ streamlit run ImageFilterApp.py
```

A new tab will be opened in your favourite web browser where you have to upload a picture.
Once it's uploaded, modify both the face detector threshold and the blur factor to get the desired results.
Finally select which face(s) you'd like to apply the blur, and download the final image!
